                <p>The process of obtaining the data members and methods from one class to another class is known as inheritance.It is one of the fundamental features of object-oriented programming.</p>

Class: A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created.</br>
Sub Class/Child Class: Subclass is a class which inherits the other class. It is also called a derived class, extended class, or child class.<br>
Super Class/Parent Class: Superclass is the class from where a subclass inherits the features. It is also called a base class or a parent class.</br>
Reusability: As the name specifies, reusability is a mechanism which facilitates you to reuse the fields and methods of the existing class when you create a new class. You can use the same fields and methods already defined in the previous class.
